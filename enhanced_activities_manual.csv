110,Trading,,4610.11,Commercial Brokerage Services,,N/A,Low,,,"Commercial brokerage means that the client will be the middleman between the seller / manufacturer of goods and the buyer of said goods.The client will earn their income from the percentage of the sale made between the 2 parties that they linked.The advantage of this activity is that the client does not need approval to be the mediator for trading goods that require 3rd party approval since the relevant approval should be with the license of the (Seller / Manufacturer) this allows for flexibility to deal with more difficult products.Under this the client can put orders to import goods however, the order has to be directed to the buyer and not the client’s company. Sometimes clients might intend to do the same activity but under general trading so it is useful to clarify whether the client will be the middleman or the direct trader. Adding a general trading activity with commercial brokerage, gives a very flexible license for trading operations. Commercial brokerage services is a difficult activity to open a bank account with.

274,Trading,,4690.97,General Trading,,N/A,High,,,"Best advised to avoid general trading if possible if the client does not know what they intend to trade, as they will struggle to clarify their business plan during bank account opening.  If the client has a few specific items they wish to trade, like construction materials or Food and Beverage then suggest those activities instead of General Trading and leverage the 3 business groups package. If the client has too many areas of trade in mind then give them General Trading to combine all the activities.  General trading is considered a high risk activity but it is not impossible as it is the 2nd most popular license in Meydan FZ, however banks don’t favor this activity due to its non specificity.  If the client is still concerned about General Trading then you can suggest to them to pick any other activity and once they obtain a bank account, amend the license to add general trading back for 2000 AED. This can also leverage a multi year license with a 15% discount since a 2 year license gives 1 free license amendment to cover up for the yearly renewal. The client can utilize said amendment any time. Expert Inisghts: Strategic Approach
Primary Recommendation
: Avoid general trading if possible and guide clients toward specific activities
Key Challenges & Solutions
Banking Difficulties
Problem
: Banks consider general trading high-risk due to non-specificity
Impact
: Banks ""don't know exactly what you are trading"" and will ""dig deeper""
Solution
: Recommend specific activities within the 3 business groups package
Client Consultation Process
Step 1: Understand Specific Products
Always ask: ""What exact products are you intending to trade under general trading?""
Example response: ""Plastic materials, toys, wooden goods""
Step 2: Recommend Specific Activities
Suggest: ""wholesale of toys, wholesale of plastic materials, wholesale of wood""
Explain: ""These three activities will cover all your needs and make banking easier""
Step 3: Address Future Expansion Concerns
Client concern: ""What if I want to trade something else later?""
Response: ""You can add activities later for 2000 AED license amendment + 1000 AED per activity""
Alternative: ""Or you can pick general trading now, but banking will be more challenging""
When General Trading is Appropriate
Client has 5-6 different product groups (more economical than individual activities)
Client genuinely unsure about specific products
Client willing to accept banking challenges for flexibility
Regulated Products Under General Trading
Cannot Trade Even with General Trading:
Gold, diamonds, precious metals (requires CERA approval)
Oil (requires DOPA approval)
Any regulated goods must be specifically listed and approved
Can Trade Under General Trading:
Food, household goods, clothes
Steel, metals (except precious metals)
Construction materials, everyday use items
Special Considerations
High-risk nationalities
: Combining with general trading creates additional banking difficulties
Business plan requirement
: Client must provide detailed business plan to banks
Workaround strategy
: ""Pick another activity, get bank account, then amend to add general tradingfor 2000 AED""
Advanced Strategy: Multi-Year License Leverage
2-year license includes 1 free amendment (15% discount)
Client can start with easier activity, then use free amendment for general trading

Solution Strategy
:
Position as advisory role: ""You can authorize blueprints as a company""
Client consultation model: ""When clients ask 'is this blueprint good?' you can advise""
Outsourcing approach: ""Take blueprint to actual engineering company for certification""
Key point
: ""You're not actually certifying anything"" - avoids approval requirements
Immigration vs Educational Consultancy
Educational Consultancy Confusion
:
Clients think: ""Advise students on curriculum""
Reality: Educational consultancy is B2B (school to consultant)
Requires approval: 15,000 AED
Solution
: Reframe as immigration consultancy
""We're going to advise which university to pick and assist with immigration""
Alternative: ""Employment placement agency - sending to university, finding employment later""
Important
: Always disclose gray area risks to client","This class includes the provision of advice, guidance and operational assistance to businesses and other organizations on management issues, such as strategic and organizational planning; decision areas that are financial in nature; marketing objectives and
